            <p>I'm the founder of a hosting company named Fire & Ice Hosting. I have been dabbling in web development for a couple years making sites for various purposes though I would mainly use a template or something of the sort for the design as I never really had faith in my design capibilities, but now I feel I'm ready to give it another try so a personal site to mark what I'm doing like a good idea to make. As I do more projects this page will be updated and hopefully in the future start looking nicer and less of an eye sore.</p>
